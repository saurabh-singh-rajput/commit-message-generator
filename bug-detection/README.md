### Task: Code Search using CoSQA dataset

- Dataset: CodeXGlue [Link](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE/tree/main/Code-Code/code-refinement/data)
- Dataset is already avalaible in the git
- Downstream Task: Code Refinement (Bug Detection)
- Downstream Description: Based on natural language search perform code refinement based on bug detection
- Usage: To refine the code
- File: train.ipynb
- Models: outputs
 
<br/>

#### How to run:
1. Open train.ipynb
2. Play around with the argument settings to change the language models, change the type of tokenizer etc.
3. create the custom model
4. Train the model
5. Test the model

##### Note: Reach out to me on teams in case if you face any issues with the execution.
